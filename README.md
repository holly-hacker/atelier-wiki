# Atelier Wiki

This repo houses the source code for my Atelier wiki. It focuses on
automatically generating pages out of information extracted from the games. As
such, it will likely be light on guides.

## Progress

Progress is tracked in the `todo.json` file. This file is maintained using the
[td](https://github.com/holly-hacker/td) todo app.

## Inspirations

The eventual end goal is to mostly obsolete these resources by making a single
place to get all info you could need about the Atelier games. However, it's
unlikely that we'll get there any time soon so for now consider them to be the
better source. If there is anything you are missing from the wiki, there's a
good chance it's documented in one of these places!
